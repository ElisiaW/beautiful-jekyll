## Notable Research Projects

*An Intelligent Underwater Robotic Smart-Sensing System for Water Quality Testing*

![Group Photo](/img/underwaterrobots.jpg)

This project consists of designing an underwater robotic unit that uses a variety
of sensors to collect data at different depth of a body of water. The data is then
collected and analyzed, and the results are used to understand and predict harmful
algal blooms through the use of water quality testing.

This project has been presented to Congress at the [Posters on the Hill 2019](https://www.cur.org/what/events/students/poh/)
conference. It will be presented at the [32nd International FLAIRS Conference](https://www.flairs-32.info/)
as well.
