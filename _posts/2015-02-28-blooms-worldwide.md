As seen in the first map below, a relatively small amount of countries were
affected by harmful algal blooms. Within the recent years, however, the
amount of countries that have been affected by this have signifigantly increased
in number. The map below demonstrates the global distribution of PSP toxins.
PSP stands for paralytic shellfish poisoning, which is present when shellfish
are contaminated with dinoflagellate algae that produce harmful toxins. Ingesting
shellfish contaminated with this results in a serious illness and can even be
fatal, as these toxins are 1,000 times more potent than cyanide.

Not only is the health of the people threatened, but there are many other
negative impacts as well. There are extreme trends of increasing algal blooms
and larger areas are being affected. This is resulting in higher economical
losses in costal communities, as well as negatively impacting fisheries resources.
World maps of other poisonings can be found ([here](https://www.whoi.edu/website/redtide/regions/world-distribution/)).
