When I was around the age 3 or 4 years old, I received a really cool robot from
my parents. I actually still have it, but it's in a storage bin somewhere.
Anyways, this cool little robot sparked my interest in technology.
I love understanding how things work. When I was younger, I was told that the
robot was *possessed* and that's why it could follow me around the house. I
didn't understand how its sensors worked. As I grew older, I eventually figured
that I could just look up more information about the robot online.
After learning more about my robot, I decided to include it in my
presentation on robotics in high school. The presentation was focused on
Boston Dynamics, however I thought bringing in my own little robot that had pretty
cool sensors for its age would definitely make things a bit more interesting.
That robot wasn't the only thing that piqued my interest in robotics; I even loved watching my family's robotic pool cleaner run around on the bottom of the pool. I found it pretty entertaining when it would occasionally rise to the top and splash my barking dog with water.
