The current methods for water quality testing either use a single sensor to
get a random sample for testing each water quality	parameter separately, or
data buoys that are able to obtain readings from multiple sensors at a
stationary location.
Our project consists of a single unit comprised of multiple sensors that are
able to collect data simultaneously for water quality testing. This
multi-sensor unit attachable to the underwater robot to collect data at various
depths of the water column for an extended period of time.
Data collection and data analysis software to manage the data and assess
certain trends in the water quality over time.

For the first prototype, we extended sensors with 30ft cable, in order to keep
the arduino board and power on surface. After reconsidering the design of the
unit, we created a second prototype which consisted of creating a waterproofed
unit to house sensors and boards on the robot, so that everything is
submersible underwater.

Two remotely operated robotic models were used: the SeaPerch robot (left) and
the MATE prototype (right). Both robotic platforms are constructed with PVC
pipe, mesh, propellers, solder, and other materials, and are easily
deconstructable. This portion of the project was possible due to the
collaborative educational project between Allegheny College and Crawford
Central School District.
