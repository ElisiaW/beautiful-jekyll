The extensive bloom present in the Yellow Sea is the largest algal bloom ever
recored in China. Along the east coast of Chinaâ€™s Shandong Province , beaches
and bays are covered in green algae that washed in from the Yellow Sea.
As this particular species of algae is harmless to humans, locals and travelers
alike continued to visit the beaches. It almost seemed to act as a tourist
attraction.

7,335 tonnes of the growth from beaches had to be removed with bulldozers. The
